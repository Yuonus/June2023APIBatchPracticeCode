		/* What kind of pattern that is?
		 * First of all this is using a BDD format, and it is a chain pattern. Chain pattern is called "Builder pattern"
		 * Builder Pattern: This pattern means each and every method is giving you the current class object.
		 */
		
		/* How do you read that pattern?
		 * Given, when I am going to call this get call, then I am getting the response and I am going to assert that status code is 200, content-type is contentType.JSON and the header is â€¦
		 * After running this above BDD format you will not get anything in the console. So how will you print all the required thing to the console?
		 * Since it is a chain method and you cannot write system.out method in the middles, and you cannot store it in a variable and then print it because it will break the chain. 
		 * So, the way around is to write .log() & .all() methods after given, when, then. We can also add the .and() method to separate the assertions.
		 * 
		 * How can you assert the body?
		 * the body assertion will happen with the help of hamcrest library. and you will have to statically import it.
		 * 		import static org.hamcrest.Matchers.*;
		 * $ -> dollar sign means in Rest Assured representing the entire response body. 
		 * 
		 * how do you read this method? .body("id", is(notNullValue())) and is it only fetching first id or all?
		 * Ans: Go to the body and check all IDs and they should not be null. and it is fetching all the IDs
		 * 
		 * How do you read this method? ->.body("title", hasItem("Mens Cotton Jacket"));. and is it only fetching one title or all titles?
		 * Ans: Rest Assured will internally create a title array and will collect all the title array and check in this title array do you have the "Mens Cotton Jacket" or not.
		 * it will fetch all the titles
		 */
		
		/*   ****** Important
		 * Remember that RestAssured Assertions are hard assertions. it does not provide soft assertions. so if one assertion
		 * fails it will not go to the next assertions

	/* Now change the limit in query parameter to 10 and run the Test getProductDataAPI_With_Extract_Body_witharray.

	 * So, what is the solution?
	 * 		Approach 1
	 * 	--> store the Generic and variable in Object data type.
	 * Refresher of Java: Object data type can store anything in it. it could be int, float, double, char, string, boolean.
	 * As you also know that Object is the super class of all classes.
	 * 		Approach 2
	 * --> Explicitly define the generic type if you don't want to store your data in Object data type.
	 *  Use this method --> getList(String path, Class<T> genericType): List<T> JsonPath
	 * 		 NOTE:
	 *  Remember that second approach could cause a miss match error in the future. because the code will print 3.0 
	 *  and the UI shows 3. this will cause validation error/miss match between UI and Back-end. So, it is alwyas
	 *  recommended to use the Object Approach
